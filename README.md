# EU-SESM

EU-SES (EUropean Sustainable Energy System Modeller) is a tool to generate a dataset with information to generate an energy sysem model.
The EU-SES encompases 28 European countries. The baseline spatial resolution is at NUTS 2 level with hourly temporal resolution.

The dataset can filtered to focus on a single country. Before generating the energy system model, the tool aggregates the data depending on the type and number of regions.
